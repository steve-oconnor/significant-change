description: An initial prototype of the significant change happy path.

The first prototype started to come together at the end of November 2020.

After discussion it was agreed that the prototypes would be best produced in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). We would be exploring new patterns and possibly new components, and using Figma rather than the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/) would make this easier. Other SDD teams were also using Figma and this would make it easier to share patterns.
