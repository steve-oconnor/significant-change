The first prototype started to come together at the end of November 2020.

After discussion it was agreed that the prototypes would be best produced in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). We would be exploring new patterns and possibly new components, and using Figma rather than the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/) would make this easier. Other SDD teams were also using Figma and this would make it easier to share patterns.
