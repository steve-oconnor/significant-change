title: Prototype 0.1
description: An initial prototype of the significant change happy path.
date: 2020-12-16

The first prototype started to come together at the end of November 2020.

After discussion it was agreed that the prototypes would be best produced in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). We would be exploring new patterns and possibly new components, and using Figma rather than the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/) would make this easier. Other SDD teams were also using Figma and this would make it easier to share patterns.

## Screenshots

1. Start page

The text here was taken straight from the existing Significant Change spreadsheets and had not been tested or fully reviewed by a Content specialist.

2. Who you are

Initially we assumed that Trusts would access this using their URN or UKPRN, which is unique to each Trust and academy. This is how it is requested on the [GIAS](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/) website.

3. Academy sense check

This is to ensure that the correct URN/UKPRN has been entered so that the details of the academy are correct.

4. Academy health check

The governance and financial health of a Trust and/or an academy are important aspects of a significant change application. Here we present the aspects that we know can be pulled from the DfE systems automatically, to test if people find this useful and understand why it is there.

5. What type of significant change would you like to make?

Due to the Academy having a good health check, here we flag them as being eligable for a fast track application. This means they will need to answer less questions than with a full business case.

Only three types of significant change can be fast tracked, so we present those options first to reduce the list size.

The fourth option displays the full list of significant change types.
