## What we did

* Remote 1:1 interviews with both internal and external users, surveys, focus groups 
* Regular contact with SMEs 
* Observation of significant points in the journey such as HTB
* The entire team were involved with every round of research, they helped to take notes, analyse sessions, and brainstormed together off the back of insight

## Who we spoke to

### Weeks 0-1

**6 trusts, 6 solicitors, 3 LAs**

Discovery-like work.
What's the experience like for the local authorities?
How are solicitors involved?
What is the process currently like for trusts?

### Weeks 2-3

**SME conversations**
**Delivery officer survey (13 responses)**

Do trusts know the difference between Fast Track and Full Business Case? 
What information is usually missing from applications? 
How do you interact with the ESFA?

### Week 4

**4 DOs, 2 RSCs, 1 SME, Head Teacher Board visit**

What information is needed to make a decision on the application? 
What do people at different points in the journey need? 
What exactly is a significant change?

### Week 5

**5 trusts, 1 SME**

What’s the real reason for the retrospectives? 
How are they reacting to the new name suggestion? 
Usability tests with the prototype focusing on the ‘check if you need to apply'.

### Week 6

**5 trusts, 2 internal colleagues (accessibility)**

Usability testing with the prototype focusing on the application form .

### Covid impact on recruitment

Trusts juggling changing requirements on schools. Very difficult for them to give us any time for research. 

Reached out to RSC network, used relationships internally to help to recruit. 

### Accessibility

We tried: 
* Asked every UR participant if they had any accessibility needs
* Reached out to Disability Network and Neurodivergent Network
* Reached out internally
* Used GDS templates to reduce risk

We can try:
* Agency recruitment 
* Testing through DAC or similar 
* Keep trying the above

### Digital confidence

By default, our users have some digital confidence. However, we saw a range of users with digital confidence and abilities. 

Many users told us verbally they were not confident with digital systems or with IT. 

### Diversity

* Variety of locations within the UK 
* Varied ages, genders, ethnicities
