## What are they?

Decision trees are a decision analysis method that uses a tree-like flowchart model to map out the decisions in a process and their possible outcomes.

## Why here?

The introduction of decision trees into the service was driven by two things.

1. The desire to capture and help those users who did not need to make an application for their required change.

2. To guide users who do need to make an application into making the correct choice for their situation.

The aim was to incorporate answers and information relating to quite commonly asked questions but that did not need to go through an approval process.

This was for two reasons; firstly, it would help reduce delivery officer workload by preventing unnecessary applications from being submitted, and secondly, we wanted to consider the wider service and not just include users that needed to apply for a change.

The first decision tree in the journey navigates the user through a set of options that are focused on identifying if the change they need requires approval. If so they are directed to the next stage, or, in the case where the change does not require approval, we provide them with information or signpost them to the relevant service that can help them.

Once the user has been established as needing to apply for a change, the second decision tree helps the user to identify the type of change they need to make an application for. The decision tree routes the user to complete the appropriate application type, simplifying the process for academies and removing an aspect of anxiety around the process.
