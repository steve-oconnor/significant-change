## We are taking a break

In recent months we have been busy tweaking the designs for the Make a change to an academy service, reviewing the processes and even adding a few more screens. However, the work will be paused for quarter 3 (September - December), to pour more resources into the other services which are now entering their private beta stage. 

Rest assures this is just a short break, and the work will resume in the future.
