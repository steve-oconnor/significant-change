The first prototype was way for me to visualise the process as I understood it, and to share that in discussion with the team. We had two sessions (one before, one after the Christmas break) which resulted in changes being made to the prototype before testing it with users.

## Prototype

## Screenshots of changes and reasoning

### 1| Changed to DfE Sign-in

All Trusts and academies have a DfE sign-in account and are very used to using it to access services. This also enables us to know which trust they are and so autofill some details.

### 2| Merging of academy details and health

There was no percieved need for seeing an academy's financial health details as seperate from the academy details, so we combined them into a single view. We also added a suggestion that a full financial healthcheck would be done by DfE.

### 3| Ability to assign sections

In user research sessions trusts talked about colleagues, solicitors, and local authoritys adding information to the application. We had the idea of being able to assign sections of the application to others, some of who would have DfE sign-in accounts already, some of whom would need to be allocated accounts.

The creator of the application - trust CEO or COO usually - would maintain full editing access, the allocated people would have full viewing access, but editing access only for the sections allocated to them.

We also saw this as a way to raise the importance of the Local Authority's input by only allowing the application to be put forward if the LA had contributed.
