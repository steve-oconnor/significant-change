The name 'Significant Change' has been proven to be problematic and devisive throughout the user research. After user feedback such as:

> A significant change is a change that is significant to the academy

> Some significant changes are more significant than others

and after internal discussions, content designer Nigel persuaded us to try 'Apply to make changes to an academy'. This fits with the GDS style for services.

User feedback also led to us moving the selection of change type to the beginning of the process. Nigel worked on bringing some clarity by tweaking the change type titles and reaaranging them into groups.

Pages were added to represent the different sections of the application form, and a preview page showing the content of all of the sections at once was also included.

Other changes can be seen in the screens below.
