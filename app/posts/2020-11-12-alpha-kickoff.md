## Problem Statement

**The Significant Change process differs regionally, utilises multiple tools, templates, and communication methods, and has a legacy internal service.**

As a result:
* Userâ€™s time is not being used as effectively as it could be
* Trusts are asked for information that DfE already has or can easily find out
* Information is requested that could have been included in the initial application
* There are multiple hand-offs between people, which can cause delays
* Information is logged on an outdated, user-unfriendly system, or sometimes not logged at all
* The status of applications is unclear
* There is an inconsistent approach as to what information is stored and where
* A large number of significant changes have to be actioned retrospectively. 

The overall process has much room for improvement in terms of ease and speed.

## Vision

**Provide a streamlined, easy to use, user-centred service to submit, assess, decide and conclude a significant change application.**


## Alpha hypotheses

### Accessibility
* Use of GDS prototyping toolkit and designs, and robust usability testing will ensure high levels of accessibility and inclusion.

### Application
* An improved and digitised application saves time, reduces data gathering, and assists the assessment process.
* In-application prompts and examples will make the application easier and people more likely to apply ahead of time (will go part way towards this).

### Knowledge
* Making it easier to find the Significant Change service and guidance will help users understand that they need to make an application in advance.

### Processing
* A library of key documents used in the decision-making process would increase standardisation.
* A level of automation and pre-population of known information in the application, as well as the templates used internally, would save internal and external users time.
