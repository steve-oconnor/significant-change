## Problem Statement

**The Significant Change process differs regionally, utilises multiple tools, templates, and communication methods, and has a legacy internal service.**

As a result:
* User’s time is not being used as effectively as it could be
* Trusts are asked for information that DfE already has or can easily find out
* Information is requested that could have been included in the initial application
* There are multiple hand-offs between people, which can cause delays
* Information is logged on an outdated, user-unfriendly system, or sometimes not logged at all
* The status of applications is unclear
* There is an inconsistent approach as to what information is stored and where
* A large number of significant changes have to be actioned retrospectively. 

The overall process has much room for improvement in terms of ease and speed.

## Vision

**Provide a streamlined, easy to use, user-centred service to submit, assess, decide and conclude a significant change application.**


## Alpha hypotheses

1. A better application with only relevant information being requested saves time, reduces data gather, and assists the assessment​
2. In-application prompts and examples will make the application easier to complete and people more likely to apply ahead of time
3. Making it easier to find the Significant Change service and guidance will ensure people understand that they need to make an application in advance ​
4. Use of the GDS prototyping toolkit, designs and usability testing will ensure increased accessibility and inclusion
5. A level of automation and pre-population of known information in the application and the templates used internally would save time and avoid the requirement to look up existing information we hold​
6. User friendly data capture and retrieval of Significant change information will improve sharing and audit​ing
7. If all information could be found in one place and the academy/trust provided the info required then assessments would be straightforward
8. ​A library of the key documents used in the decision-making process would increase standardisation​.
