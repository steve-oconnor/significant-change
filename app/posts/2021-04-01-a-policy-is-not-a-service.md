**Make changes to an academy was originally called Significant Change**

From discovery findings, it was clear that there was an issue for users with the idea of Significant Change. What’s significant? In who’s opinion? 

This was reinforced in research sessions with examples such as:

>A whole school’s moving to a completely new building, but the building’s capacity is no bigger than the old one. That’s not a significant change.

That’s clearly a significant event for the school, but it doesn’t need to follow the Significant Change process.

When we asked delivery officers, policy people, and academy leaders, “What’s a significant change?” often the response wouldn’t go further than, “A change that’s significant”.

Clearly, there was a problem.

There were also pointers to the same problem when the guidance had to outline what changes might be considered ‘significant’ by applicants but didn’t need to follow the Significant Change process.

And having the original team name as Significant Change narrowed the policy, and not around the full problem that users were experiencing.

## Learnings

If I was to take some key learnings away from this situation, it would be that when the name problem was identified, next time I’d try to understand the higher levels up of the problem (does this problem sit within a wider problem?) first and then make the team’s name reflect that - and engage with stakeholders so they understand that there is a distinction between the policy name and the digital service. 

Prolonging the team’s use of ‘Significant Change’, I believe, centered thinking on the internal policy, rather than the wider user problem. 

Significant Change is a policy. It is only a problem for users because of the complexity of the policy. But it is also part of a wider problem for users which is about ‘making changes to academies’ than finding out if the change they want to make requires them going through the significant change process, or some other process to make sure it is correctly reflected in the funding agreement, which needs to be right.

##Arriving at a new service name

Following the guidance provided in the Service Design Manual, allowing the service name to encompass the whole user problem. 

The Trust or Academy wants to make a change. We have to make it as simple as possible for them to find out if they need to follow the significant change process, or not.

Current service name: **Make changes to an academy**
