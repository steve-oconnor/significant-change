It became clear when exploring what patterns might be appropriate to help users navigate the whole problem the significant change policy presents for academies, that the step by step navigation lent itself well to the process because: 

>The step by step navigation pattern presents an end-to-end journey in logical steps, providing links for users out to the content that helps them complete each step. 

It represents the end to end journeys: 
that have a specific start and end point
that require the user to interact with several pieces of guidance or transactions on GOV.UK 
where it’s helpful for the user to complete tasks in a specific order.

##Naming the steps 

###Step 1 – Check which changes need approval

Why: This is a ‘decision tree’ that cuts through the complexity of the present guidance.

There are opaque reasons why something is or isn’t considered a ‘Significant Change’. By being presented with the change you want to make, and then being told what you need to do, is a better serving of the guidance and easier navigation of the policy.

###Step 2 – How to run a consultation  
And – How to complete an Equalities Impact Assessment

The department provides general guidance about who it thinks a consultation should involve – but will not define absolute guidance as each change is different.

The point of the consultation is to avoid retrospective challenges and appeals. Helping people understand what is involved in a consultation, and the general principles around them should help academies to make them more robust and valid.

The equalities impact assessment is a requirement in the policy, But, not everyone seems to complete one. It is a requirement of the Equalities Act 2010 and so is included as a distinct stand-alone part of the service – but part of this ‘stuff we’ve got to do’ section.

###Step 3 – Check the academy’s details are up to date on GIAS

We’ve used the acronym GIAS for the Get Information About Schools service and spelled it out in full in the link because we have found that users better understand the acronym.

We have debated whether it is a distinct step in its own right (or not) – but have decided it is currently because:
Feedback from stakeholders is that the information held in GIAS is frequently not up-to-date 
It takes up to 24 hours to update. This means it would be a disruptive journey to include during the application itself (Step 4) as it wouldn't update immediately and would mean the application couldn’t continue.

###Step 4 – Sign in to DfE and apply for approval 
Because that’s what you do here. 
 
###Step 5 – Getting the decision and amending the funding agreement
